Regarding the DeerRun walking pad I ordered (114-5912903-7963456), it has been a few months and I understand the item is not eligible under general return policy. HOWEVER, the treadmill has stopped working, and DeerRun is not honoring the 1-year warranty after several attempts to contact them. (My husband received one initial response in which he was asked to provide a video demo of the problem along with the order #. After providing the requested information on December 26, he has not received any follow-up, and he has reached out two times since with no response.)
